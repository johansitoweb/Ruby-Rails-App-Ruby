# The ideal number of threads per worker depends both on how much time the
# application spends waiting for IO operations and on how much you wish to
# prioritize throughput over latency.
#
# As a rule of thumb, increasing the number of threads will increase how much
# traffic a given process can handle (throughput), but due to CRuby's
# Global VM Lock (GVL) it has diminishing returns and will degrade the
# response time (latency) of the application.
#
# The default is set to 3 threads as it's deemed a decent compromise between
# throughput and latency for the average Rails application.
#
# Any libraries that use a connection pool or another resource pool should
# be configured to provide at least as many connections as the number of
# threads. This includes Active Record's `pool` parameter in `database.yml`.
